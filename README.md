## :scroll: Description
This app lets the user see the available unadopted puppies in the neighbourhood and adopt them.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Many times we see that people leave so many puppies in a cardboard box at the corner of a road. These cuties need to be adopted and taken care of. So this app helps these puppies to be adopted by someone who can properly take care of them.
